Week 01 assignment

Part 1

I chose "for" as a looping structure to generate the complete URLs of each page and output files as well. The looping reads all elements of an array with only the page numbers, that are concatenated
to the URL and output file name. This logic is represented in scrape1.js. However, the output files are not beibng created accondingly (will debug later).

I decided to go with an alternate way less elegant solutiuon where it repeats the code 10 times to get to the output files. You ca see it in scrape2.js.
