Week 01 assignment

Part 1

I chose "for" as a looping structure to generate the complete URLs of each page and output files as well. The looping reads all elements of an array with only the page numbers, that are concatenated to the URL and output file name. This logic is represented in scrape1.js. All url, path and file names are concatenate correctly (debugging inside looping structure). However, the output files are not being created accondingly (will debug later).

I decided to add an alternate way less elegant solutiuon where it repeats the code 10 times to get to the output files. You can see it in scrape2.js.
