For this week's assignment I picked the m09.txt as my N number ends in "769".

As instructed, I used a cheerio object to parse the html content of m09.txt.

I made use of several regular expressions to clean the output and replace unwanted text and get exactly what I was looking for, only the street names, with no extra white spaces, extra line breaks or tabs. Please check the comments on week_02.js.

Also, as instructed, I used fs.writeFileSync to write the output file, m09_week_02.txt.

Included files:
README.md
m09.txt
week_02.js
data/m09_week_02.txt
